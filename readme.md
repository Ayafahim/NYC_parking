# üöì NYC Parking Fines & Urban Disparities

This project investigates how parking violations in New York City are distributed across neighborhoods ‚Äî and whether there are disparities when compared with population and demographic data.

We explore questions like:
- Which neighborhoods receive the most fines?
- Are lower-income areas fined more frequently per capita?
- Do different boroughs have different dominant violation types?
